# Furniture Website (Figma to React Code)

This project is a React code implementation of a furniture website design by [Eyob Mekonnen and Andualem Belete]. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the conversion of the Figma design into a fully functional React application.

## Design

The design for the furniture website was created by [Nait Creative](https://www.figma.com/@naitcreative) in Figma, a popular web-based design tool. The design includes various components such as a home page, products, shopping cart.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop this React code implementation:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TailwindCSS: Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework

## Getting Started

To run this React code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd furniture-website`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

- The `src` directory contains the main source code of the React application.
- The `components` directory holds individual React components responsible for rendering different pages and sections of the website.
- The `App.js` file is the entry point of the application and handles routing between different pages.
- The `index.js` file is responsible for rendering the root component into the DOM.
- The `index.css` file provides global styling for the application.
